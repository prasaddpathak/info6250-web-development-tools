The intention is to create a web 2.0 job platform. On this platform employers can login and post job openings. Students can login and look for open positions and apply to the roles.

Data will be generated by employers and candidates across job creation and and job application. Employers can view the complete details of the condidates who apply to thier open roles. Once the roles are closed, candidates will no-longer be able to apply.

I will be using Spring Boot as the backend on the application and will be using a sql database to store are the data and login crendentials
